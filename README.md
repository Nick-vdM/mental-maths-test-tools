# Mental Maths
While most websites are enough to just practice mental maths, they
don't usually follow an exact guide for improving on it and are just random exercises.
I waned to make a set of tools that actually follows a guide to getting better.

These exercises are based off [Secrets Of Mental Math: The Mathemagician's Guide to Lightning Calculation and Amazing Math Tricks](https://www.amazon.com.au/Secrets-Mental-Math-Arthur-Benjamin/dp/0307338401)
## Installation guide
At the moment this can only be installed on Linux/Unix systems - windows will have to install through WSL

Run this from your downloads (or whereever):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Nick-vdM/mental-maths-test-tools.git
$ cd mental-maths-test-tools
$ source installer.sh
```
Then you can run any of these commands from anywhere
```
addition
subtraction
multiply
square
complement
```
