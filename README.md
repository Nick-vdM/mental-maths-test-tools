# Maths Testing Tools
While most websites are enough for me to practice mental maths,
I wanted to be able to fully customise what I can do with it. That's
the point of this.

These exercises are based off [Secrets Of Mental Math: The Mathemagician's Guide to Lightning Calculation and Amazing Math Tricks](https://www.amazon.com.au/Secrets-Mental-Math-Arthur-Benjamin/dp/0307338401)
## Installation guide
At the moment this can only be installed on Linux/Unix systems - windows will have to install through WSL

Run this from inside the main folder:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Nick-vdM/mental-maths-test-tools.git
cd mental-maths-test-tools
source installer.sh
```
Then you can run any of these commands from anywhere
```
addition
subtraction
multiply
square
complement
```
