# Maths Testing Tools
While most websites are enough for me to practice mental maths,
I wanted to be able to fully customise what I can do with it. That's
the point of this.
## maths_test_tools.py
Contains all the functions to run a question
## addition.py
Runs the addition function over and over to practice with
## subtraction.py
Runs the subtraction function over and over to practice with
## multiply.py
Runs the multiply function over and over to practice with
## square.py
Runs the square function over and over to practice with
## complement.py
Runs the complement function over and over to practice with. Functions by asking
you to find the distance between two numbers i.e. 54's complement from 100 is 56
## custom.py
TODO
Runs a random function in maths_test_tools.py over and over
